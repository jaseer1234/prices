Choose a programming language and web framework for your API. Python is a popular choice for web development, and Flask and FastAPI are popular web frameworks for creating RESTful APIs.

Install the necessary packages for web scraping and web development, such as requests, beautifulsoup4, and Flask.

Write the code to scrape the website and extract the latest price. You can use the requests and beautifulsoup4 packages to fetch and parse the HTML content of the website.

Write the code to define a route for your API endpoint. In Flask, you can use the @app.route() decorator to define a route that returns the latest price.

Test your API locally to make sure it is working as expected. You can use a tool like curl or a web browser to send GET requests to your API endpoint and verify that it returns the latest price.

Deploy your API to a cloud platform like Heroku or AWS. You will need to create an account, set up a new application, and configure your deployment settings.

Test your API on the cloud platform to make sure it is working correctly. You can use the same tools as before to send GET requests to your API endpoint and verify that it returns the latest price.
